# CS2 Server Manager

Automated multi-server management for Counter-Strike 2. Deploy multiple dedicated CS2 servers in minutes with competitive plugins, auto-updates, and tournament integration.

Designed to work hand-in-hand with:

- **[MatchZy Auto Tournament](https://mat.sivert.io)** – web UI and API for automated CS2 tournaments.
- **[MatchZy Enhanced](https://github.com/sivert-io/MatchZy-Enhanced)** – enhanced MatchZy plugin for in-server automation.

## What it does

- **Multi-server deployment**: Spin up 3–5 CS2 servers with a single command.
- **Tournament-ready stack**: Installs Metamod, CounterStrikeSharp, MatchZy (enhanced), and AutoUpdater.
- **Safe updates**: Handles game and plugin updates automatically while preserving your configs.
- **Persistent overrides**: Everything in `overrides/` survives updates.
- **Observability & control**: Go-based CLI/TUI and tmux integration for logs and debugging.

## Quick Start

For most users, installing `csm` globally and running the TUI is all you need:

```bash
arch=$(uname -m); \
case "$arch" in \
  x86_64)  asset="csm-linux-amd64" ;; \
  aarch64|arm64) asset="csm-linux-arm64" ;; \
  *) echo "Unsupported architecture: $arch" && exit 1 ;; \
esac; \
tmp=$(mktemp); \
curl -L "https://github.com/sivert-io/cs2-server-manager/releases/latest/download/$asset" -o "$tmp" && \
sudo install -m 0755 "$tmp" /usr/local/bin/csm && \
rm "$tmp" && \
sudo csm            # launches the interactive TUI installer
```
