# CS2 Server Manager

Automated multi-server management for Counter-Strike 2. Deploy multiple dedicated CS2 servers in minutes with competitive plugins, auto-updates, and tournament integration.

Designed to work hand-in-hand with:

- **[MatchZy Auto Tournament](https://mat.sivert.io)** – web UI and API for automated CS2 tournaments.
- **[MatchZy Enhanced](https://me.sivert.io)** – enhanced MatchZy plugin for in-server automation.

## What it does

- **Multi-server deployment**: Spin up 3–5 CS2 servers with a single command.
- **Tournament-ready stack**: Installs Metamod, CounterStrikeSharp, MatchZy (enhanced), and AutoUpdater.
- **Safe updates**: Handles game and plugin updates automatically while preserving your configs.
- **Persistent overrides**: Everything in `overrides/` survives updates.
- **Observability & control**: Handy management script and tmux integration for logs and debugging.

## Quick Start

For most users, this is all you need:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivert-io/cs2-server-manager/master/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

For automated installs (no prompts):

```bash
bash install.sh --auto --servers 5
```

Read the **Getting Started** section for a full walkthrough.
